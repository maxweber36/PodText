# PodText
My first Capstone Project: PodText.

## Product Idea
This idea stems from my personal scenario of learnning English with a pain point.
Recently, I have been learning English every day. My main methods include reading English articles and maintaining a streak on Duolingo. Meanwhile, as a podcast enthusiast, I want to listen to overseas podcasts, but I  often struggle to understand the converstions. With English articles, I can look up unfamiliar words in a dictionary . But for podcasts, I haven't found a suitable tool to parse content  I am interested in. Therefore, I aim to build a tool that helps me better understand podcasts.

## Product Features
1. **Speech-to-text transcription**. It can transcribe speech to text, so I can read the text to clarify parts I couldn't hear clearly.
2. **Audio fetching.** It can fetch podcast audio files from web pages.
3. **Translation & parse**. It supports translating and parse transcribed content
4. **Summarization**.  Additionally, it would ideally provide summaries and analyses of podcast content.

These are my initial ideas for the products.
